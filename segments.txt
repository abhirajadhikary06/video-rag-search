[0.00 - 5.84]  Ever wondered how Google translates an entire webpage to a different language in a matter of seconds?
[5.84 - 9.68]  Or your phone gallery group's images based on their location?
[9.68 - 12.40]  All of this is a product of deep learning.
[12.40 - 15.28]  But what exactly is deep learning?
[15.28 - 21.12]  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial intelligence.
[21.12 - 26.40]  Artificial intelligence is a technique that enables a machine to mimic human behavior.
[26.48 - 31.68]  Machine learning is a technique to achieve AI through algorithms trained with data.
[31.68 - 37.20]  And finally, deep learning is a type of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human
[37.20 - 42.88]  brain. In terms of deep learning, this structure is called an artificial neural network.
[42.88 - 47.36]  Let's understand deep learning better and how it's different from machine learning.
[47.36 - 51.92]  Say we create a machine that could differentiate between tomatoes and cherries.
[51.92 - 55.76]  If done using machine learning, we'd have to tell the machine the features
[55.76 - 61.04]  based on which the two can be differentiated. These features could be the size and the type
[61.04 - 66.32]  of stem on them. With deep learning on the other hand, the features are picked out by the neural
[66.32 - 71.84]  network without human intervention. Of course, that kind of independence comes at the cost of
[71.84 - 78.00]  having a much higher volume of data to train our machine. Now, let's dive into the working of neural
[78.00 - 84.24]  networks. Here we have three students. Each of them write down the digit nine on a piece of paper.
[84.88 - 90.56]  Notably, they don't all write it identically. The human brain can easily recognize the digits.
[91.20 - 96.96]  But what if a computer had to recognize them? That's where deep learning comes in.
[96.96 - 100.48]  Here's a neural network trained to identify handwritten digits.
[101.04 - 108.80]  Each number is present as an image of 28 times 28 pixels. Now, that amounts to a total of 784
[108.80 - 114.72]  pixels. Neurons, the core entity of a neural network, is where the information processing
[114.72 - 121.68]  takes place. Each of the 784 pixels is fed to a neuron in the first layer of our neural network.
[122.24 - 128.40]  This forms the input layer. On the other end, we have the output layer with each neuron
[128.40 - 133.92]  representing a digit with the hidden layers existing between them. The information is transferred
[133.92 - 140.16]  from one layer to another over connecting channels. Each of these has a value attached to it, and
[140.16 - 146.48]  hence is called a weighted channel. All neurons have a unique number associated with it called bias.
[147.28 - 153.44]  This bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs reaching the neuron, which is then applied to a
[153.44 - 159.76]  function known as the activation function. The result of the activation function determines
[159.76 - 166.08]  if the neuron gets activated. Every activated neuron passes on information to the following layers.
[166.72 - 173.04]  This continues up till the second last layer. The one neuron activated in the output layer
[173.04 - 179.28]  corresponds to the input digit. The weights and bias are continuously adjusted to produce a well
[179.28 - 185.04]  trained network. So, where is deep learning applied? In customer support, when most people
[185.04 - 190.40]  converse with customer support agents, the conversation seems so real. They don't even
[190.40 - 196.08]  realize that it's actually a bot on the other side. In medical care, neural networks detect
[196.08 - 203.04]  cancer cells and analyze MRI images to give detailed results. Self-driving cars. What
[203.04 - 209.68]  seemed like science fiction is now a reality. Apple, Tesla, and Nissan are only a few of the
[209.68 - 216.64]  companies working on self-driving cars. So, deep learning has a vast scope, but it too faces some
[216.64 - 223.12]  limitations. The first as we discussed earlier is data. While deep learning is the most efficient
[223.12 - 229.28]  way to deal with unstructured data, a neural network requires a massive volume of data to train.
[229.28 - 234.72]  Let's assume we always have access to the necessary amount of data. Processing this is not
[234.72 - 240.48]  within the capability of every machine. And that brings us to our second limitation,
[240.48 - 246.56]  computational power. Training a neural network requires graphical processing units,
[246.56 - 253.92]  which have thousands of cores as compared to CPUs. And GPUs are of course more expensive.
[253.92 - 261.28]  And finally, we come down to training time. Deep neural networks take hours or even months to train.
[261.28 - 267.20]  The time increases with the amount of data and number of layers in the network. So, here's a
[267.20 - 272.88]  short quiz for you. Arrange the following statements in order to describe the working of a neural
[272.88 - 281.44]  network. A. The bias is added. B. The weighted sum of the inputs is calculated. C. Specific neuron
[281.44 - 288.32]  is activated. D. The result is fed to an activation function. Leave your answers in the comment section
[288.32 - 294.24]  below. Three of you stand a chance to win Amazon vouchers. So, hurry! Some of the popular deep
[294.24 - 301.12]  learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Deep Learning 4j, Caf√©, and Microsoft
[301.12 - 307.44]  Cognitive Toolkit. Considering the future predictions for deep learning and AI, we seem to have only
[307.44 - 313.20]  scratched the surface. In fact, Horace Technology is working on a device for the blind that uses
[313.20 - 319.12]  deep learning with computer vision to describe the world to the users. Replicating the human mind at
[319.12 - 326.48]  the entirety may be not just an episode of science fiction for too long. The future is indeed full
